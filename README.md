#Project Description
For this project we wanted to make a website that would use price marks of GPU's on eBay and compare them to find the best deal for your buck! ...
#Project Expectations
For this project we decided to use google cloud and python as the back end, along with the implemntation of the eBay API. For the front end we decided to go with JS, CSS, and HTML.
#What we would include if we had more time
If we had more time we would like to configure the front end to be more clean and user friendly, as well as include other PC parts, such as CPU, Hard drive, power supply, SSD, and mother boards. 
#What we had trouble with
One of the most pressing issues we had was working with the ebay API, as well as getting a license to be able to work with it in the first place. We also had some learning curve with python since neither of us had used it extensively as a back end before now.
