## Project Description
For this project we wanted to make a website that would use price marks of GPU's on eBay and compare them to find the best and worst deal for your buck! To do this we
used google cloud services and utilized the cloud function service. We used python for the back end, which worked phenomenally with the eBay API. For the front end we
used HTML and a little CSS. We were less focused on the front end since the back end is where all the magic happened!

## Issues
One of the most pressing issues we had was working with the eBay API, as well as getting a license to be able to work with it in the first place. We also had some
learning curve with python since neither of us had used it extensively as a back end before now. The only API we could find that was usable for our
situation was ebaysdk-python, the issue we had with this was that we had to remove the keys due to eBays terms of service. When we tried to get our own keys, the only
one we could get was the sandbox version. The sanbox version unfortunately does not allow for use on google cloud. This was a huge issue that we unfortunately did not 
find a solution to. Neither of us could afford the professional key so we had to limit our success to only running on each of our local machines.

## What We Would Include If We Had More Time
If we had more time we would like to configure the front end to be more clean and user friendly, as well as include other PC parts, such as CPU, Hard drive, power
supply, SSD, and mother boards. We would also like to save up for the professional version of the eBay API key so that it could fully function on google cloud.
